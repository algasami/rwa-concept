      <p>
        You need a wallet to use Ticket Tool. You can create a wallet using hot
        wallet services or use a hardware wallet. Once you have a wallet, you
        can start buying and selling tickets on Ticket Tool. Note that ticket
        tool is merely an interface to interact with the blockchain, albeit some
        features are centralized to store information that is otherwise too
        expensive to store on the blockchain.
